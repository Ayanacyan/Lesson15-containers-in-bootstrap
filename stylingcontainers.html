            <p>Scientists predict that glaciers will melt completely in a few thousand years if this doesn't stop</p>
            <p>That would mean serious tempratures and even humans will be in danger</p>

            <h2>Polar Bears and other ice requiring creatures might die</h2>
            <p>Many populations would move to the coast for colder tempratures but get flooded because of water levels</p>
            <p>There would hardly be any safe place for humans to survive</p>
